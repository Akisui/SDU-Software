#### § 6.1

37. **How many functions are there from the set $\{1, 2, . . . , n\}$, where $n$ is a positive integer, to the set $\{0, 1\}$**

    *a)*  that are one-to-one?

    ​	i.  If $n = 1~\text{or}~2$ , the answer is $2$

    ​	ii. If $n > 2$ , the answer is $0$

    *b)*  that assign $0$ to both $1$ and $n$?

    ​	Each number in ${2,...,n-1}$ has two choices, which lead to $2^{n-2}$ totally for $n > 1$

    ​	For $n=1$ , the answer is 1

    *c)*  that assign $1$ to exactly one of the positive integers less than $n$?

    ​	There are exactly $(n-1)$ positive integers less than $n$, meaning that $(n-1)$ choices to assign $1$, so the answer is $(n-1)$.



50. **How many bit strings of length $10$ contain either five consecutive $0$s or five consecutive $1$s?**

    To solve the problem, we consider where the string of five or more consecutive $0$s starts. 

    - If it starts at the first bit, then $1$st - $5$rd bits are all $0$, meanwhile each of the last five bits has two choices $1$ or $0$ without limitation, which lead to the count in such condition that $2^5 = 32$. 

    - If it starts at the 2nd bit, the first bit has to be $1$ and similarilly, it turns out to be $2^4=16$ kinds of string as $4$ free bit. 

    - If it starts at bits $3$-$6$, the bit before this string must be $1$, and the bit before this $1$ and after the string all have two choices, $0$ or $1$, so the number of free bits is $4$ as well.

    It turns out to a total of $32 + 5 \times  16 = 112$ strings that contain five consecutive 0s.

    For consecutive 1s, there are also 112 kinds of them symmetrically.

    Finally, we subtract the two strings (1111100000 and 0000011111) that were double-counted to get the answer $2 \times 112 - 2=222$.



51. **How many bit strings of length eight contain either three consecutive $0$s or four consecutive $1$s?**

    **We consider where the string of three or more consecutive 0s starts.**

    - If it starts at the first bit, 000xxxxx has $2^5=32$ choices for five free x.
    - If it starts at from the second bit (1000xxxx) to the sixth bit (xxxx1000), for each condition, it has $2^4 = 16$ choices which lead to total $5 \times 16 = 80$ choices.
    - But some choices are doubly counted for the situation like 000x1000 etc. We have to substrate $5$ (00010000, 00010001, 00001000, 00011000, 10001000) away from $32 + 80$ to get $107$.

    Then consider where the string of four or more consecutive 1s starts.

    - If it starts at the first bit, 1111xxxx has $2^4=16$ choices for four free x.
    - If it starts at for the second bit (01111xxx) to the fifth bit (xxx01111), for each condition, it has $2^3 = 8$ choices which lead to total $4 \times 8 = 32$ choices.
    - Check to find that there is no choice counted doubly, then we get $16 + 32 = 48$.

    Now, gather them together to get $107 + 48 = 155$.

    Finally, we find there are $8$ choices (00001111, 11110000, 11111000, 00011111, 00011110, 10001111, 01111000, 11110001) containing both 000 and 1111, so the answer is $155-8=147$.



61. **A wired equivalent privacy (WEP) key for a wireless fidelity (WiFi) network is a string of either 10, 26, or 58 hexadecimal digits. How many different WEP keys are there?**

    Obviously, the answer is $16^{10} + 16^{26} + 16^{58}$.
