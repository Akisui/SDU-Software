## 2.	Traditional Chinese Medicine

In its long history of 5,000 years, the Chinese nation, with its unique culture of <u>traditional Chinese medicine</u>, has explored the great TCM way of life, which is **bound** to become **irreplaceable** and leading in the historical process of saving human **crises**. The great TCM way of life is an important magic **weapon** for the post-modern world to cure difficult and **miscellaneous** diseases, **resolve** medical crises, transform development modes, promote circular economy and innovative economic models, and even improve the quality of life, **harmonize** human life and realize future civilization. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that "the culture of traditional Chinese medicine **embodies** the **profound** **philosophical** wisdom of China's 5,000-year-old culture" and "is the key to unlocking the treasures of Chinese civilization".

## 5.	Chinese Painting and Calligraphy

Chinese **landscape** painting, or "landscape painting" for short, is a Chinese painting that mainly **depicts** the natural landscape of mountains and rivers. It was formed during the Wei, Jin, North and South Dynasties, but had not yet been completely separated from figure painting. It became independent during the Sui and Tang Dynasties, and **matured** during the Five Dynasties and the Northern Song Dynasty, becoming an important **genre** of Chinese painting.

中国山水画，简称“山水画”，是以山川自然景观为主要描写对象的中国画。它形成于魏晋南北朝时期，但尚未从人物画中完全分离。隋唐时始独立，五代、北宋时趋于成熟，成为中国画的重要画科。

Chinese landscape painting is the heaviest **sediment** of Chinese people's emotions. The **consciousness** of **continental** culture of playing in the mountains and rivers, the **consciousness** of inner **cultivation** with <u>mountains as **virtue** and water as nature</u>, and the **consciousness** of visual **illusion** of “<u>so close, yet worlds apart</u>” have always become the main **axis** of the **interpretation** of landscape painting. From landscape painting, we can <u>focus on</u> the <u>mood, style, charm and tone</u> of Chinese painting. <u>There is no other painting that can</u> give more emotions to the Chinese people <u>as landscape painting does</u>.

中国山水画是中国人情思中最为厚重的沉淀。游山玩水的大陆文化意识，以山为德、水为性的内在修为意识，咫尺天涯的视错觉意识，一直成为山水画演绎的中轴主线。从山水画中，我们可以集中体味中国画的意境、格调、气韵和色调。再没有哪个一个画可能够像山水画那样给国人以更多的情感。
